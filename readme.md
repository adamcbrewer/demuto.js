### Changing your styles for the worse!

This tool is to give a much easier way to toggle the Modernizr classes appended to the ```html``` element.
It's primarily for ensuring progressive enhancment or gracefully degrading styles during development.

Either drag the the bookmarklet to your bookmarks toolbar, or inlude the script and create a new instance:

```
var demuto = new Demuto({
    M: Modernizr
}).init();
```

Have a lovely day!
